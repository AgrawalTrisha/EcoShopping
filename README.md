EcoShopping is an app that uses data from local stores and a smart refrigerator to promote sustainable food saving practices and an anti-waste lifestyle. EcoShopping uses data from a smart refrigerator to create a list of items in the fridge. This is done using a combination of a barcode scanner, a camera, a and a user interface for manual entry. Next, EcoShopping determine the expiration date for each product and an estimated percentage used. EcoShopping can use this list to determine the products that are going to expire the soonest. With this list, it uses myfridgefoods.com to determine possible recipes that would utilize as many of the soon to expire foods. This will cut down on food waste as it helps you use foods before they expire and reminds you to use them before they expire. The EcoShopping app is also connected to a smart trash can that provides data about what was thrown out and how much. It acquires this data the same way the fridge does and shares info with it to make sure that it adds up. By determining what you use a lot of, what you need to make a recipe, and what you throw out often, Ecoshopping makes a shopping list for you that lowers you food waste as it only has things that youâ€™re likely to use and/or need. 
Thus, the EcoShopping app is a great part of the solution to combat food waste. It helps you cut out purchases that you are likely to throw out and cut down on food that is soon to go bad by prioritizing their use over others.
